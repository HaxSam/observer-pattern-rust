# Observer Pattern in Rust

I tried to make a observer pattern in rust.

Idea is when the subscription drops the object that implement the observer trait stays.
When the object drops the subscription drops also.

Iam open for other ideas how to implement a observer pattern, make a pull request when u have something cool.
